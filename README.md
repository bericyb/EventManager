# EventManager
A small ruby program that generates thank you letters for event participants and encourages political activism. 

This program takes a csv file and retrieves information about each attendee's local legislators by zip code using the Google Civic Info API. Then the respective legislators and their websites are formatted into an addressed letter which can be sent to each attendee.

Required fields in the csv file are names and zipcodes. 

Created as part of the Odin Project's Ruby coursework
